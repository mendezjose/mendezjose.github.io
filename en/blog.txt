As design engineers, we're often defined by the 1% of our work that makes it into the final product. That shiny, polished piece of engineering is a result of countless iterations, tweaks, and redesigns. But what happens to the other 99%—those ideas, concepts, and prototypes that never see the light of day? They remain tucked away in the drawer, both literally and figuratively.

## The Beauty of Unused Ideas

It’s easy to think of discarded designs as failures, but in truth, they’re stepping stones. Each one represents a path explored, tested, and ultimately left behind. Those early drafts may never become reality, but they play a crucial role in shaping the solution that does. They teach us what works and, more importantly, what doesn’t.

## The Process of Elimination

In every project, the first few ideas often come quickly. They’re intuitive, straightforward, and sometimes too simple. As we dive deeper, we explore more creative solutions, test the limits of materials and technology, and challenge the initial assumptions. This process of elimination is not about rejecting ideas but about refining them. The 99% left in the drawer is evidence of rigorous thinking and thorough exploration.

## Why the Drawer Matters

For every concept that didn’t make it, there’s a lesson learned. A sketch that looked promising might fail in prototyping. A concept that seemed impractical might be revisited years later, finding new relevance with advancements in technology or a change in project scope. These shelved ideas serve as a knowledge base—a library of possibilities for future projects.

## Innovation Through Failure

Many breakthrough innovations are born from revisiting old, seemingly failed concepts. What didn’t work in one context might be the key to solving a problem in another. As design engineers, we should never be afraid to open the drawer and revisit those shelved ideas. They are a testament to the iterative nature of design, where nothing is truly wasted.

## Final Thoughts

The final product is just the tip of the iceberg—the visible 1%. The other 99% may never see the spotlight, but they are just as important. They represent the trial and error, the persistence, and the creative drive that push us to find the best solution. So next time you’re stuck or looking for inspiration, don’t be afraid to dig into the drawer. The answer might be hiding there, waiting for the right moment to shine.e:T1003,
The Rise of Design Engineering
In recent years, the role of design engineering has evolved from a specialized niche to a critical component in the development of innovative products and solutions. The seamless integration of design principles with engineering expertise has become essential in shaping not only the functionality of products but also the user experience, sustainability, and overall impact. So, what’s driving this shift, and why is design engineering more relevant than ever before?

## Where Engineering Meets Creativity

Traditionally, engineering and design were viewed as separate disciplines. Engineers focused on solving technical problems, while designers were concerned with aesthetics and user experience. However, as products become more complex and user-centered, the need for a unified approach has grown. Design engineering bridges this gap by combining the precision of engineering with the creativity of design. It’s where form meets function, ensuring that products are not only technically sound but also intuitive, visually appealing, and user-friendly.

## The User-Centered Revolution

One of the biggest factors in the rise of design engineering is the shift toward user-centered design. Whether it’s a smartphone, a medical device, or an automotive system, today’s products are expected to be intuitive, responsive, and aligned with user needs. Design engineers play a pivotal role in this transformation by focusing on the end-user from the very beginning of the development process. Instead of approaching design and engineering as separate stages, they merge them into a cohesive workflow that considers usability, ergonomics, and aesthetics alongside structural integrity and functionality.

## Sustainability and Innovation

As the world becomes increasingly conscious of environmental impacts, design engineers are at the forefront of creating sustainable solutions. From selecting eco-friendly materials to designing for energy efficiency and minimizing waste, their work is crucial in driving sustainability initiatives across industries. The role of the design engineer extends beyond merely meeting technical requirements; it involves finding innovative ways to achieve sustainability without compromising on performance or aesthetics.

## The Digital Transformation

The digital revolution has also played a significant role in the rise of design engineering. Advanced tools such as computer-aided design (CAD) software, simulation, and rapid prototyping have empowered design engineers to push boundaries and experiment with ideas that were previously impossible. Virtual testing and iterative development processes allow for quick adjustments and refinements, enabling more sophisticated and optimized designs. This integration of digital technology with traditional engineering practices has made design engineering a dynamic and rapidly evolving field.

## Collaboration and Interdisciplinary Work

In the modern product development landscape, collaboration is key. Design engineering brings together experts from various fields—mechanical engineering, industrial design, electronics, materials science, and more—into a cohesive team. This interdisciplinary approach fosters innovation by allowing for a broader perspective on problems and solutions. Design engineers often act as the glue that holds these teams together, ensuring that everyone’s contributions align to create a product that is both technically sound and user-centric.

## Looking Ahead

The rise of design engineering signals a fundamental shift in how we approach product development. It’s no longer enough to have a product that simply works; it must also resonate with users, be sustainable, and push the boundaries of innovation. As technology continues to advance and user expectations evolve, design engineers will be increasingly critical in shaping the future. Their unique blend of creative thinking and technical expertise will continue to drive the development of products that are not only functional but also meaningful.2:["$","$L8",null,{"fillWidth":true,"maxWidth":"s","direction":"column","children":[["$","script",null,{"type":"application/ld+json","suppressHydrationWarning":true,"dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"Blog\",\"headline\":\"Writing about design and tech...\",\"description\":\"Read what Selene Yu has been up to recently\",\"url\":\"https://demo.magic-portfolio.com/blog\",\"image\":\"demo.magic-portfolio.com/og?title=Writing%20about%20design%20and%20tech...\",\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"name\":\"Selene Yu\",\"image\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"url\":\"demo.magic-portfolio.com/images/avatar.jpg\"}}}"}}],["$","$L9",null,{"marginBottom":"l","variant":"display-strong-s","children":"Writing about design and tech..."}],["$","$L8",null,{"fillWidth":true,"flex":1,"direction":"column","children":[["$","$La",null,{"columns":"repeat(1, 1fr)","mobileColumns":"1col","fillWidth":true,"marginBottom":"40","gap":"m","children":[["$","$Lb","new-milestone-in-my-career",{"post":{"metadata":{"title":"Arriving to a new milestone in my career","publishedAt":"2024-04-08","summary":"Every career is a journey, filled with challenges, growth, and those significant moments that mark a shift in our path.","image":"/images/gallery/img-02.jpg","images":[],"tag":"Journal","team":[]},"slug":"new-milestone-in-my-career","content":"$c"},"thumbnail":true}],["$","$Lb","the-99-percent-that-remains-in-the-drawer",{"post":{"metadata":{"title":"The 99% that remains in the drawer","publishedAt":"2024-03-05","summary":"As design engineers, we're often defined by the 1% of our work that makes it into the final product.","image":"","images":[],"tag":"Journal","team":[]},"slug":"the-99-percent-that-remains-in-the-drawer","content":"$d"},"thumbnail":true}],["$","$Lb","the-rise-of-design-engineering",{"post":{"metadata":{"title":"The rise of design engineering","publishedAt":"2024-03-05","summary":"In recent years, the role of design engineering has evolved from a specialized niche to a critical component in the development of innovative products and solutions.","image":"","images":[],"tag":"Technology","team":[]},"slug":"the-rise-of-design-engineering","content":"$e"},"thumbnail":true}]]}],false]}],["$","$Lf",null,{"newsletter":{"display":true,"title":["Subscribe to ","Selene","'s Newsletter"],"description":"I occasionally write about design, technology, and share thoughts on the intersection of creativity and engineering."}}]]}]
